<p> <img src ="..//assets/images/dragonquest_v_01_1600.png" height="200" alt="DQ5"> </p> 
<p> The best dragon quest I have played so far - it has monster recruiting, you go through the hero's entire life and you even have kids!</p>

<h3>Dragon Quest XI</h3>
<p> <img src ="../assets/images/wp3630314.png" height="200" alt="DQ11"> </p> 
<p> The "first" dragon quest chronologically, also the most widely available and gosh, it has the most amazing graphics.</p>

<h3>Dragon Quest VIII</h3>
