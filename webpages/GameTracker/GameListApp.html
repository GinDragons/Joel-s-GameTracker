    <h1>My Game List</h1>
  </div>

<h4> Do you have many many unfinished games that you "paused" only to completely forget where you currently are in the game because you barely have time to game (or even to breathe) because of work and your <i>wonderful</i> three year old and so you have to restart all the game all over again to try to enjoy it but this creates an endless loop creating more unfinished games resulting in you still playing games that were launched 10 years ago? 
</h4>

<h4> Never fear! MyGameList is here! With myGameList, you can now track all your games in one place, noting where you last left off and how much you enjoyed the game! Also, to further reduce your mental load, myGameList has a recommender function, to help you decide what to play! </h4>

<h5> P.S. This app is brought to you with the great support of Angela Yu, the TechUP teams videos and of course, the true MVP - CHADGPT. </h5>
